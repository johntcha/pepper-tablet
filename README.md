This project is the web application on Pepper, the robot from Softbank Robotics, I made through a scholar project.
This website quickly introduce the Polytech Annecy-Chamb√©ry engineering school but the most important feature is the "Guide moi Pepper".
It represents the feature allowing users to ask Pepper to lead them to a room in the University. All rooms and professors are linked to this table by a database.
